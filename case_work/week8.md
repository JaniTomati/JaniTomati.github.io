### Product pricing - 30.10.20

#### Cost-based pricing
- What are our expenses?
  * Counted for 3 person team per month
  * Since we are running an online business expenses are limited just to three categories that are mentioned in the table below
  * Later on various costs for services and online services might be added, but for the very beginning of the entrepreneurship venture they are hard to identify or non-existing
- Total:
  * Monthly: 70750 dkk
  * Yearly: 849000 dkk

| Expenses |  dkk  |
|---|---|
| Salaries | 60000 |
| Office space (+ maintenance) | 7000 |
| Hardware | 3750 |

If we would want to make profit with these expenses, having 20 customers we should be charging them 3500 dkk montly.
