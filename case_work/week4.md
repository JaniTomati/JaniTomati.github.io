- Who is the customer? 
  * Companies that need to maintain their own water pipelines and that gather a sufficient amount of data doing so (e.g. aarhusvand)
- What job(s) do you try to carry out in relation to your idea?
  * Identify and analyse interesting or deviating data in the real-time flow,
  * Compare the water consumption (e.g.  this years consumption during a pandemic comparedto last years consumption),
  * Predict the future water consumption,
  * Detect leaking pipes,
  * Predict the probability of a pipe leakage
- Which needs have you identified and have you found unsatisfied needs? 
  * Predictive maintenance 
    - We did not get the chance to talk to the experts from aarhusvand, however, our research revealed that there exists no sufficient solution to predict future pipe leakage 
  * Predictive consumption 
    - From the business case provided by aarhusvand we gathered that the need of analysing and predicting consumption in relation to real-life events is still under-served
- Create and opportunity landscape diagram. Reflect about the model qualities in relation to your idea. 
- Did you acquire new insights?
