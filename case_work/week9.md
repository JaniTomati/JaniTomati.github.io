#### Market size 

We can anaylse the market size for our product / service in two ways. Firstly, we can take a look at the potential customers and secondly, we can analyze the potential competitors in the market.

1. Local (Aarhus)
  - After researching providers of data visualization consultancy for quite some time, we could not find a company that offers this type of service in directly Aarhus. It might be that there are freelancers based in Aarhus that work on visualization and data anylsis, however, the website initially only lists the country that the workers are from. When looking at the more precise location, none of the freelancers were based in Aarhus. 
There are a lot of companies based in and around Aarhus [1]. Moreover, there is a startup community evolving at the moment [2]. We could find out that entrepreneurs establish more than 1200 companies in Aarhus each year (5400 in greater Aarhus) [3]. Our business model is based on the fact that small companies might not have the means to offer positions for data visualization and analysis and would therefore like to hire an external company to build solutions for them. Since there are a lot of new startups / companies being created each year and no direct competition in Aarhus when it comes to this type of service, it might be a good market to get started in. 
2. Regional (Denmark) 
- Of the data visualization and analysis consultancies that we have found, none were located in Denmark. There are however a few freelancers that offer similar services to customers that are based in Denmark [4]. 
Unfortunately, we could not find a total number of startups that are being established every year in Denmark, however, Denmark is frequently named as one of the top countries to start a business in and makes it easy for people to start their own company [5]. We therefore assume that Denmark as a whole shows the same potential as Aarhus when it comes to the market. 
3. World-wide
- During our search for competitors, we found some data visualization and anaylsis consultencies. Most of them are based in the US, some of them have branches in India, the UK or Canada as well. This could mean that we lack data visualization consultancies in Europe. 
According to Get2Growth there are 100 million startups being established each year [17]. This means that there are potentially a lot of customers that would like to gain insight into their data. Most of the succesful startups are established in the US [18], however, creating a consultancy that is closer to the European market could be beneficial. This means that customer and service provider do not have a large time difference and are generally closer than a customer from Europe would be to the US.

#### Competitor map 
1. __Power BI / Tableau__: These software solutions make it easy for customers to create their own visualization reports without needing to code. This makes it very easy for unexperienced users to create their own visualization reports without any expertise in the field. However, this also means that there is the potential that users do not get the full potential from their data. They might choose the wrong form of visualization for their data or make other mistakes that result in a bad visualization. Addionally, they are also limited by the chart types that Power BI provides. There are ways to extend the visualizations but that can be very hard or beginners and it takes a lot of reading into the matter to get to the result that you might want to [6] [7]. 
2. __BI Consultancy__: As part of our research we found some consultancy companies that offer to produce visualization reports, forecasts and predictions using the clients data. From what we could gather, most of these companies actually use services like Power BI and Tableau to create the reports for their customers. The service they provide is supposed to make the most of the data and provide easy analysis for the customer [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14].
3. __Freelancers__: Similar to BI consultancy companies, there are also freelancers that offer to do data visualization and analysis for their customers [15].
4. __Business expansion__: In our business hypothesis, we assume that customers are willing to hire a consultancy company to deal with their data needs because they don't have the resources themselves, however, this also means that we should take into account that a potential customer might spend their money on actually hiring someone full time as a domain expert so that there would be no need for an external service. This means we need to make our service as attractive as possible so that customers don't feel the need to directly hire someone specifically for that task. 
5. __Visualization Workshops__: Another potential competitor could be companies that organize data visualization workshops and provide style guides [16]. Combining the workshops with solutions such as Power BI and Tableau could mean that it's not necessary anymore for a company to hire an external consultancy, i.e. at least for rather simple visualizations and analysis.

#### Sales process
Customers that might be interested in our product start with the need for insights into their data. They might research different solutions as to how work with the data they gather currently. During their search process they probably get confronted with different options like self-service BI visualization tools (Power BI, etc.), freelancers that offer visualizations services and consultancy companies that are specialized in data visaulization and analysis. Some companies might decide that the simplest and cheapest solution would be to start visualizing their data themselves if they feel somewhat comfortable with certain softwares already. Others might not feel the same or do not want to invest their own resources into this task and look for an external hire. At this point in the consumer decision journey, a consultancy can most likely impress their potential customers with a nice website and a portfolio. We have seen some freelancers that do the same thing, however, many of them did not have their own website and were registered in a job portal. It was really hard to see what kind of work they were actually doing and how they would justify their prices. The only thing that was helpful at that point were customer reviews. A custom website with transparent information could therefore give the potential customer a feeling of high quality. In order to challenge the customer that might still be torn between using a service like Power BI themselves or to hire someone to do the job for them, we could highlight some of the most common mistakes in data visualization. This could be especially important since a lot of the consultancies also just use tools like Power BI and Tableau which could make the customer wonder why they should actually hire someone to use a tool that they could very well also use. Positive and negative examples could make the customer more aware about their understanding of data visualization and why they should hire an expert for the task. In order to get the potential customer to consider contacting us, we should display an email address or phone number prominantly on the screen after a certain amount of time spent on the website. Alternatively, we could also open up a live chat on the website where potential customers can directly contact an employee during business hours. The biggest problem when challenging a consumer is to show how much more beneficial a visualization can be to their company when done by a professional than when they create these visualizations themselves.
