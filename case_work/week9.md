#### Market size 

We can anaylse the market size for our product / service in two ways. Firstly, we can take a look at the potential customers and secondly, we can analyze the potential competitors in the market.

1. Local (Aarhus)
https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/aarhus-companies
2. Regional (Denmark) 

3. World-wide


#### Competitor map 
1. __Power BI / Tableau__: These software solutions make it easy for customers to create their own visualization reports without needing to code. This makes it very easy for unexperienced users to create their own visualization reports without any expertise in the field. However, this also means that there is the potential that users do not get the full potential from their data. They might choose the wrong form of visualization for their data or make other mistakes that result in a bad visualization. Addionally, they are also limited by the chart types that Power BI provides. There are ways to extend the visualizations but that can be very hard or beginners and it takes a lot of reading into the matter to get to the result that you might want to.

2. __BI Consultancy__: As part of our research we found some consultancy companies that offer to produce visualization reports, forecasts and predictions using the clients data. From what we could gather, most of these companies actually use services like Power BI and Tableau to create the reports for their customers. The service they provide is supposed to make the most of the data and provide easy analysis for the customer.

3. __Freelancers__: Similar to BI consultancy companies, there are also freelancers that offer to do data visualization and analysis for their customers.

4. __Business expansion__: In our business hypothesis, we assume that customers are willing to hire a consultancy company to deal with their data needs because they don't have the resources themselves, however, this also means that we should take into account that a potential customer might spend their money on actually hiring someone full time as a domain expert so that there would be no need for an external service. This means we need to make our service as attractive as possible so that customers don't feel the need to directly hire someone specifically for that task.
