#### Market size 

We can anaylse the market size for our product / service in two ways. 

1. Local (Aarhus)
2. Regional (Denmark) 
3. World-wide


#### Competitor map 
1. __Power BI / Tableau__: These software solutions make it easy for customers to create their own visualization reports without needing to code. This makes it very easy for unexperienced users to create their own visualization reports without any expertise in the field. However, this also means that there is the potential that users do not get the full potential from their data. They might choose the wrong form of visualization for their data or make other mistakes that result in a bad visualization. Addionally, they are also limited by the chart types that Power BI provides. There are ways to extend the visualizations but that can be very hard or beginners and it takes a lot of reading into the matter to get to the result that you might want to. 
2. __BI Consultancy__: As part of our research we found some consultancy companies that offer to produce visualization reports, forecasts and predictions using the clients data. From what we could gather, most of these companies actually use services like Power BI and Tableau to create the reports for their customers. The service they provide is supposed to make the most of the data and provide easy analysis for the customer.
