#### Market size 

We can anaylse the market size for our product / service in two ways. Firstly, we can take a look at the potential customers and secondly, we can analyze the potential competitors in the market.

1. Local (Aarhus)
  - After researching providers of data visualization consultancy for quite some time, we could not find a company that offers this type of service in directly Aarhus. It might be that there are freelancers based in Aarhus that work on visualization and data anylsis, however, the website initially only lists the country that the workers are from. When looking at the more precise location, none of the freelancers were based in Aarhus. 
There are a lot of companies based in and around Aarhus [1]. Moreover, there is a startup community evolving at the moment [2]. We could find out that entrepreneurs establish more than 1200 companies in Aarhus each year (5400 in greater Aarhus) [3]. Our business model is based on the fact that small companies might not have the means to offer positions for data visualization and analysis and would therefore like to hire an external company to build solutions for them. Since there are a lot of new startups / companies being created each year and no direct competition in Aarhus when it comes to this type of service, it might be a good market to get started in. 
2. Regional (Denmark) 
- Of the data visualization and analysis consultancies that we have found, none were located in Denmark. There are however a few freelancers that offer similar services to customers that are based in Denmark. 
Unfortunately, we could not find a total number of startups that are being established every year in Denmark, however, Denmark is frequently named as one of the top countries to start a business in and makes it easy for people to start their own company [4]. We therefore assume that Denmark as a whole shows the same potential as Aarhus when it comes to the market.

#### Competitor map 
1. __Power BI / Tableau__: These software solutions make it easy for customers to create their own visualization reports without needing to code. This makes it very easy for unexperienced users to create their own visualization reports without any expertise in the field. However, this also means that there is the potential that users do not get the full potential from their data. They might choose the wrong form of visualization for their data or make other mistakes that result in a bad visualization. Addionally, they are also limited by the chart types that Power BI provides. There are ways to extend the visualizations but that can be very hard or beginners and it takes a lot of reading into the matter to get to the result that you might want to.

2. __BI Consultancy__: As part of our research we found some consultancy companies that offer to produce visualization reports, forecasts and predictions using the clients data. From what we could gather, most of these companies actually use services like Power BI and Tableau to create the reports for their customers. The service they provide is supposed to make the most of the data and provide easy analysis for the customer.

3. __Freelancers__: Similar to BI consultancy companies, there are also freelancers that offer to do data visualization and analysis for their customers.

4. __Business expansion__: In our business hypothesis, we assume that customers are willing to hire a consultancy company to deal with their data needs because they don't have the resources themselves, however, this also means that we should take into account that a potential customer might spend their money on actually hiring someone full time as a domain expert so that there would be no need for an external service. This means we need to make our service as attractive as possible so that customers don't feel the need to directly hire someone specifically for that task.
