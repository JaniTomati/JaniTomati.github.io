#### Technology and imbalances or social changes
- Pipe infrastructure in the water industry ages and is more prone to breaking
- Sensor technology can detect leaks based on changes in acoustic  
  * Data can be used to start predicting the probability for a pipe to be breaking 
- UN expect 50% of the population to live in areas of high water stress by 2030
  * people want to be more sustainable 
  * to give access to water to the whole population we need to save and reuse water 

#### Jobs to be done 
- Monitor current water consumption (real-time)
- Compare consumption (e.g. to the consumption of the previous week or the consumption of this year during the pandemic to last years consumption) 
- Predict future consumption 
- Detect leaking pipes 
- Predict the probability of a pipe leakage
